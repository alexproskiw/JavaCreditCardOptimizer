> A Java project by Alexander Proskiw

## <ins>Application Purpose:</ins>
According to the Bank of Canada, 9 in 10 Canadians own a credit card. Most of
these cards provide some type of reward, such as getting cashback or aeroplan points 
for every dollar you spend.

The purpose of this application is to:
- Allow the user to create a list of credit cards they are interested in;
- View and modify the credit cards in this list; and 
- Get a recommendation for the best credit card optimized to their personal monthly spending. 

The optimized recommendation will account for the difference in value between reward types 
by converting each reward type to an equivalent $ value.

## <ins>User Information</ins>
This application will be used by people who want to minimize credit card fees while maximizing their rewards.

Key user stories that will be implemented throughout the phases of the project include:
- As a user, I want to be able to add/remove credit cards to/from a list of credit cards I'm considering using. At minimum, a credit card will have a name, annual fee, and reward rate.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a credit card from the list and view/modify its details.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my list of credit cards so that I can reload it when the application restarts.
- As a user, I want to receive a recommendation of the credit card that will give me the highest reward value based on my monthly spending.

## <ins>Project Rationale</ins>
This project is of interest to me because for years I simply 
had a basic credit card from my bank. But recently, I discovered
that based on my current spending I could get hundreds of dollars 
in rewards more if I had a different credit card from a different bank.

When I first started assessing other credit card options, I utilized excel.
However, it was a very tedious process, and begged to be automated.
Hence, the idea for this Credit Card Optimizer application was born.

## <ins>Disclaimer and limitations:</ins>
1. *Credit cards often carry high interest rates. 
You should avoid carrying a balance whenever possible.* 
2. *The purpose of this application is not to encourage
you to spend more just to earn more rewards. It is not worth spending
money you don't have just to earn a few extra dollars in
rewards.*
3. *For the sake of simplicity and equal comparison, this project focuses 
solely on the rewards earned through regular spending. Limited time 
offers associated with specific credit cards such as signup bonuses have 
not been considered. Similarly, less tangible perks such as airport lounge 
access and VIP status have not been accounted for.*
